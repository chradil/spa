Algeria was once a central territory of the Roman Empire through the 16th century when it became part of the Ottoman Empire. Following the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the country had a brief period of independence before France launched a war in 1830 to colonize the land. France suppressed Algerian resistance, making it a French colony. While France modernized Algeria's agricultural and commercial economies, they also sewed ethnic resentment through the creation of an elite class with only a few Algerians allowed in; this led to a massive nationalist movement and war for independence that lasted from 1954-1962. Algeria achieved independence in 1962. In the 21st century, Algeria has one of the largest economies in Africa. Algeria has a population of 34 million, 99% of which are Sunni Muslims.

Egypt's influence in the Arab and Islamic world is unparalleled, especially in areas of intellectual and cultural development and traditions. In 1517 the Ottoman Empire defeated the Egyptian Mamluks and took control over Egypt until 1788 when Napoleon I led the French army and took control of the country. French occupation ended in 1801 but opened the door for more European colonization. Egypt's location has long made it a strategic location for trade routes between Africa, Europe, and Asia. In 1869, the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, sedimented Egypt's strategic position. This only intensified European desire to colonize there, and in 1882 the British occupied Egypt until after World War II. In 1952 a military coup put a revolutionary regime that promoted Pan-Arab nationalism and socialism into power. Egypt has an authoritarian political system that was dominated by a president, ruling party, and security services. This oppressive system, along with mass demonstrations in neighboring countries, led to Arab Spring protests in Egypt in 2011. These protests forced President Hosni Mubarak to leave office, and the government transferred power to a new government in 2012, where the country formed a new constitution.

Ghana's colonial name was ""Gold Coast' and was occupied as a British colony from 1821 - 1957. Colonizers not only exploited Ghana for its gold but used its ports for the slave trade. Ghana achieved independence in 1960. Ghana relied on economic aid starting in 1982, boosting the economy through increased tourism and ecological reserves. In 1979 Jerry Rawlings took power through a coup, doing it again in 1981 after briefly handing power over civilian control. Rawlings embraced the IMF, building programs towards structural adjustment that international donors held up as a ""model."" In 1992, following pressure from donors concerned with Rawling's dictatorship, the government allowed a multiparty election system. Rawlings won the presidential election in 1996; but lost to John Mills in 2000, allowing for a transfer of power. In 2008 John Mills was re-elected.","Guinea-Bissau is a West-African country with a population of 1.5 million. 30% of this population lives in urban areas, about 400,000 of whom live in Bissau, the capital city.

Almost all of Lesotho's population is ethnically Basothos, an ethnicity that has several sub-groups. Lesotho has always had a close political relationship with South Africa. During the colonial era, South Africa tried to incorporate successfully resisted, and in 1966 Leosthos established itself as a constitutional monarchy. Chief Leabua Jonathan and the Basotho National Party (BNP) won the first election. Jonathan and his party were immediately in conflict with the King, Moshoeshoe II.

Liberia,liberia_img.png,"Liberia is a country with 4 million residents. 1.1 million Liberians are living in its capital city Monrovia. The country has more than 15 ethnic groups, which remained relatively ignored by colonization until 1820 when the American Colonization Society (ACS) - founded in 1817 - began sending freed American slaves back to Africa. These settlers became known as Americo-Liberians, and until the 1980s, they held most of the country's political power, despite accounting for only roughly 3% of the population. The country has undergone a series of wars, partly between the elites and the rest of the people, along with other conflicts along ethnic divides. These wars have killed around 200,000 people and displaced about 700,000. The education system, along with the level of development, has fallen. Agriculture remains an important source of revenue for Liberia; its main cash crop is rubber. Logging has also supported the country's GDP as there are an estimated 3.8 million hectares of productive forest in the country. Liberia also has many minerals, including iron ore, gold, and diamonds; much of the fighting, as mentioned earlier, has been around gaining control over these minerals. In 1980 a civil war began in Liberia with a military coup led by Master-Sergeant Samuel Doe; this ended the 150-year reign of Americo-Liberian political power. Doe, from the ethnic group Kahn, reigned with ruthless repression. Following a fabricated election in 1985, a failed coup by the Gio group, a full civil war erupted in 1989 when Charles Taylor and fellow Americo-Liberian rebel forces invaded. By 1990, neighboring West African countries sent a peacekeeping force which became involved in offensive operations. Doe was assassinated in November of 1990; many failed peace deals and successions of alliances and splits between warring factions ensued. In 1995 a peace deal and elections were won by Taylor, whose rule was oppressive. In 1999 another civil war broke out, and Taylor, after being pressured by the US, fled to Nigeria. The UN and 15,000 peacekeepers led a two-year provisional administration, and in 2005, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf won the presidential election; she was re-elected in 2011.

Water remains a big problem in Libya; the government made a 20$ billion-dollar human-made river scheme, planning to pump water at great expense. It is far from completion. For 42 years, the Libyan's government was run by Muammar Qaddafi, who overthrew the country's monarch in a military coup in 1969. Qaddafi claimed to run a socialist government for the people; in reality, he held all the power, assisted by 'revolutionary committees,' which enforced many human rights abuses ranging from arbitrary arrests to torture and disappearances. Qaddafi used Libyan oil wealth to incite a series of terrorist incidents culminating in bombing the 1988 Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. His overthrow began in February 2011 following Arab Spring protests in Egypt and Tunisia. Many population protests against his regime in Benghazi grew into an armed insurrection that benefited from UN approved NATO protection.

Nigeria is home to 148 million people, with 50% living in urban areas, making it the most populous country. Nigeria is a federation of 36 states and is home to over 400 ethnic groups; the three main ones are the Hausa-Fulani, Muslim, the Yoruba who follow Christian and Islam faiths, and the Igbo, most of whom are Christians. Agriculture makes up about 40% of the country's GDP. Oil was discovered in the country in 1956, which by 2008 accounted for 90% of the country's export earnings. Much of the oil wealth was not distributed widely, with military leaders at the top stealing the wealth. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960, and ethnic conflicts over shares of the oil revenue have occurred.
In 1967 the Eastern region led by a military governor attempted to secede from Nigeria - a civil war followed that spanned 2.5 years. There have been a series of military coups since. In 1993 General Sani Abacha led a violent military regime; he came to power following an annulment of the presidential election. Abacha imprisoned the selected president, Chief Abiola, and launched violent attacks on the opposition. He died in 1998. A presidential election in 1999 followed with Olusegun Obasanjo and the People's Democratic Party (PDP) taking office. He was re-elected in 2003. In 2007 Umaru Yar'Adua was hand-selected to take office, and in 2010 following his health issues, he handed power to his vice-president Goodluck Jonathan. Jonathan was elected in 2011; violence broke out in the north, with 800 people dying as a result. The most significant contemporary threat in contemporary Nigeria is Boko Haram - an Islamist fundamentalist group that aims to overthrow the state and impose Islamic rule. Boko Haram was founded in 2002 and has carried out a series of violent acts, including suicide bombings and abductions. In May 2014, Boko Haram abducted 300 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok.

Zimbabwe,zimbabwe_img.png,"Zimbabwe is a country of 12 million people. 1.4 million people live in the capital city Harare. Zimbabwe's main population is the Shona, who have been in the region for over 1,000 years. The Ndebele, a smaller group, arrived in the 19th century. From 1911-1964 the country was known as the Republic of Zimbabwe, and from 1964-80 it was known as Southern Rhodesia, and then Rhodesia from 1979-1980. Starting in 1965, the country was dominated by the white minority and colonial rule under the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. In 1980 the country achieved black majority rule, and Robert Mugabe became prime minister. Mugabe set out to redistribute the race and class-based inequalities, to redistribute land from the white minority, and promote economic development as a one-party socialist state. The 1980s brought an economic downturn and white flight. In 1998 Mugabe intervened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's civil war to protect his own investments, and international aid to Zimbabwe was suspended as a result. By 2000, calls to end Mugabe's autocratic rule were present. Mugabe continued his aggressive program of confiscating white farm owners' land in 2002, which in turn left thousands of Black farmworkers homeless and unemployed. The property was not redistributed instead claimed by political allies. Mugabe's policies continue to economically distress the country through the 21st century, with several failed attempts by others to run against him. Each time, Mugabe used intimidation and police violence on opposition candidates and their supporters. In 2009 Tsvangirai joined Mugabe in a new government that altered the constitution and established a prime minister role. The change resulted in economic growth in the years following, though Mugabe was declared the winner of the 2013 elected under results characterized as fraudulent. Following this election, Mugabe's wife Grace began amassing political support for herself. In November 2017, the military seized power and placed Mugabe under house arrest and Grace's supporters. Demonstrations across the country highlighted that Mugabe had little support left, and on November 19th, he was removed from office with Mnangagwa elected in his place. Grace was fired from her position. Mugabe still refused to resign though Mnangagwa was inaugurated as interim president on November 24th, 2017. Elections were held for the first time in 16 years on July 30th, 2018, and after a delay, Mnangagwa was declared the winner.","Stalker, P. (2010). Zimbabwe.

        <dd>Ghana is a country of 23 million. Its capital city is Accra, which 1.6 million people call home. Ghana's population is comprised of dozens of ethnic groups, the largest being the Akan. About half of Ghanaians make their living from agriculture, such as maize, yams, and cassava. The major cash crop is cocoa; the country's significant exports are gold, cocoa, and timber. Ghana was first colonized by the Portuguese, who arrived in 1471. Ghana's colonial name was "Gold Coast' and was occupied as a British colony from 1821 - 1957. Colonizers not only exploited Ghana for its gold but used its ports for the slave trade. Ghana achieved independence in 1960. Ghana relied on economic aid starting in 1982, boosting the economy through increased tourism and ecological reserves. In 1979 Jerry Rawlings took power through a coup, doing it again in 1981 after briefly handing power over civilian control. Rawlings embraced the IMF, building programs towards structural adjustment that international donors held up as a "model." In 1992, following pressure from donors concerned with Rawling's dictatorship, the government allowed a multiparty election system. Rawlings won the presidential election in 1996; but lost to John Mills in 2000, allowing for a transfer of power. In 2008 John Mills was re-elected.</dd>

        <dd>Guinea-Bissau is a West-African country with a population of 1.5 million. 30% of this population lives in urban areas, about 400,000 of whom live in Bissau, the capital city. Guinea-Bissau has many ethnic groups, the Balanta and Fulani accounting for about half of the population. Two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line, and life expectancy is 48 years, and it one of the lowest in the world. Education standards are poor, and only about half of the children are enrolled. About 60% of the country's GDP comes from agriculture; rice, millet, sorghum, cassava, and other root crops are exported. The main cash crop is cashew nuts. Guinea-Bissea became independent in 1974 and was federated with Cape Verde. Between 1974 and 1999, the country was ruled by the Partido Africano da Independencia de Guinea e Cabo Verde (PAIGC). In 1980, General Joao Bernardo Vieira seized the party in a coup; he broke Guinea-Bisseau from Cape Verde, opening the government to other political parties in the 1990s. Vieira retained control until 1999 when he was overthrown.  Presidential and legislative elections were established, and Kumba Yala became president. Yala died in 2014, and his presidency is remembered as "erratic and incompetent." In 2003 the military intervened, and in 2005, Viera was voted back into office - he was then assassinated in 2009. Malam Bacai Sanha won the presidential election in 2012 and died later that year. Carlos Gomes Junior replaced him and another military coup ensued, driving Gomes to exile in Portugal.</dd>

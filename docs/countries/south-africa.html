            <p>The southernmost country on the continent has narrow coastal plains along with mountainous regions in the east. About two-thirds of the country is on a plateau. An estimated 49 million South Africans live in the country, 1.9 million in the capital city Pretoria. South Africa was first colonized in 1652 by an expedition of Dutch Calvinist colonizers who received a commission Dutch East India Trading Company. They set up a station for passing ships. By 1657 the Dutch started allowing farms to the European settlers. By 1795 the British Crown occupied the region, seizing the territory and pushing the Dutch north, they created the Cape Colony. As the British expanded, encroaching on the land of Khoikhoi, then the Xhosa, following by the Tembu, Pondo, and Fingo. The Xhosa fought nine wars over the course of a century, gradually forcing them under British rules. In 1854 the contract of Bloemfontein was signed, and the Republic of Orange Free State was founded by the Boers. A war between the British and the Boers began in 1899; the British occupied Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, and Pretoria. The British continued to destroy Boer farms and placing women and children in segregated concentration camps; 28,000 died. A peace treaty was signed in 1900, though the conflict between the White administration and Africans intensified. The pro-white colonial policies led by Alfred Milner enacted discriminatory policies. Long-standing South Africa became a fully sovereign nation-state within the British Empire in 1934. By 1948 the National Party (NP) instituted apartheid, which segregated South Africa by racial groups fueled by anti-blackness and white supremacy. South Africa's post-apartheid period began with Nelson Mandela leaving prison in 1990. In 1993 he won the Nobel Peace Prize, and in 1994 the first multi-racial election won elected the African National Congress, won 63% of the votes, and elected him president. Mandela retired in 1999, and Thabo Mbeki won in 1999 and 2004. Jacob Zuma won the 2008 election.</p>

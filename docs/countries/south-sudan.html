            <p>This northeastern country has a rich biodiversity, including savannas, swamplands, and rainforests. In 2011 it achieved independence from Sudan, which is now its northern neighbor. South Sudan's population holds predominantly Christian or animist religious beliefs. Its capital is Juba. In the 19th century, Sudan was under British-Egyptian rule. The British saw less resistance to their occupation in the north, leading to a stark dichotomy of development between the north and the south. Sudan achieved independence in 1956. Several governments followed, all of which had difficulty uniting the diverse political landscape between the north and the south. Notably, northern leaders sought to extend Islamic law and culture to the south, which led to a civil war that lasted from 1955- 1972. The Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972 ended the war temporarily, with fighting resumed from 1983-2005. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2005, and the war ended with new outlines for how to distribute power and wealth. It also granted South Sudan semiautonomous status that allowed a referendum for independence to occur in six years. The referendum did happen, and the independence vote passed in January 2011 with overwhelming support. On July 9th, 2011, South Sudan declared independence. Most of the South Sudan population lives in rural spaces clustered along watercourses due to its longstanding water supply problems. Agriculture is the primary source of employment in the country.</p>

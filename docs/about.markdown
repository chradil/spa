<p>Youth-led protests over the past fifteen years have stimulated a resurgence of global social movements that have radically reshaped the world. As a Digital Scholarship project, School Protest In Africa provides empirical evidence of the important contributions of education to fostering impactful forms of political engagement.</p>

<p>The global Occupy movement, the Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, and anti-corruption movements in Asia and Latin America have all shifted protests to the forefront of public discourse. Student protests, in particular, are now “suddenly ubiquitous” after decades of decline, positioning schools as a key context for contemporary political participation.. In response to these developments, a growing body of scholarship has emerged, which examines the relationships between schools and contemporary activism.</p>

<p>With the growing incidence of youth-led protests around the world over the past 15 years, scholars have attempted to understand the factors shaping the political “awakening” of global youth, who are defined in this literature as ranging in age from 15 to 30 years old. Until this recent wave of activism, youth of the 1990s and early 2000s were often characterized as apolitical and disconnected from conventional forms of political participation.</p>

<p>Our mixed methods approach tracks the incidence and causes of school-based protest in Africa since 2000, and with support from the Spencer Foundation we’ve been able to make the database and map publicly accessible online.</p>

			<p> Jimil is a PhD student and Research Assistant at Penn GSE. Her current research interests consider the theoretical and material intersections and experiences of youth, resistance, and new media practices. My work seeks to critically examine the ways youth, new media, and resistance are joined in social practice: namely, how new media cultivates new spaces for resistance; how youth are central actors in new forms of media representation and resistance; and how resistance practices are central to the ways in which youth are represented and the extent to which their personhood and ways of being are socially legitimized.</p>

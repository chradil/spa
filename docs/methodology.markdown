<p>This research documents the significant role of educational institutions and school actors in contemporary political activism and struggles for social change in Africa. 
Specifically, this research asks: (1) What is the incidence of protest in educational institutions in Africa, (2) what are their explicit causes as defined by participants, and (3) What patterns exist within and across countries? 
</p>
<p>Since 2016, this study has worked to aggregate the first--and to our knowledge only--cross-national database of school-based protests in Africa since 2000. The year 2000 was selected as a starting point for this research because this is when an empirical gap on school protests in scholarly research begins, and also when a discernible resurgence in popular protests in Africa roughly begins.Previous pilot research produced data on school-based protests in two African countries, Nigeria and South Africa (Strong, 2018), and to date this research has collected data on school protests in all 54 African countries. 
</p>

<p>In addition to developing a comprehensive dataset in this area, this project utilizes an interactive mapping technology to visualize and make this data publicly accessible. This study aims to amplify and support the work of educational activists, and to provide researchers and practitioners with empirical data that will help them better understand the role of schools in contemporary political processes in Africa with the hope that further research will facilitate deeper analysis with reference to this under-studied region as well as the formulation of policies that support the potential of schools to positively affect social change.

<p>The School Protests in Africa dataset aggregates data on the incidence of school-based protests in African countries using archival research and web-based data aggregation tools developed in connection with the Google and Twitter application programming interfaces (APIs). In more lay terms, this means that we use web-based news and media sources to collect data on protest events since 2000. Because protests in this region are underreported in national and international news, this study also centers self-reported protest activities on social media platforms that are more accessible to youth. 
</p>

<p>To date, we have catalogued over 1,100 incidents of school protest across all 54 African countries since 2000, and recorded supplementary data on protest events including the groups of actors involved, the targets, causes of contention, and institutional and state responses. 
</p>

<p>An incident is considered a school protest event if it involves more than one actor and meets at least one of the following other criteria: (1) it is a social or political disturbance that takes place in a school or (2) it is a social or political disturbance that involves school actors (i.e., students, teachers or academic staff, non-academic staff, school administrators, or youth). We consider the following to be social or political disturbances that qualify as protest events: protests or demonstrations; riots or violence; strikes, boycotts, or industrial action; actions that result in school closure; vandalism or property destruction; roadblocks or other physical obstructions of activity; and online or media campaigns.

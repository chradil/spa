<p>This research provides empirical evidence of the important contributions of education to fostering impactful forms of political engagement. Specifically, this research asks: (1) What is the incidence of protest in educational institutions in Africa, (2) What are their explicit causes as defined by participants, and (3) What patterns exists within and across countries? Over a 15-month period, this study will create the first cross-national database of school-based protests in Africa since 2000. Previous pilot research produced data on school-based protests in two African countries, Nigeria and South Africa (Strong, 2018). this research will collect comprehensive data in all 54 African countries. In addition to forming a comprehensive dataset in this area, this project will utilize an interactive mapping technology to visualize and make the data publicly accessible. This study will help researchers and practitioners better understand the role of schools in political processes and conflict in Africa. Furthermore, this data will support further research that allows for comparative analysis with reference to this under-studied region, as well as the formulation of policies that leverage the potential of schools to positively affect political change.</p>

<p>This research draws on and contributes to three primary areas of scholarship: research on global youth and student activism; political movements in Africa; and education in Africa</p>

<p>The research questions guiding this study are: (1) What is the incidence of protest in
educational institutions in Africa, (2) What are their explicit causes as defined by participants, and (3) What patterns exists within and across countries?</p>

<p>The research methods employed in this study include: archival research, case studies, and spatial data aggregation and analysis. Using archival research and web-based data aggregation tools developed in connection with the Google, Twitter and Facebook application programming interfaces (APIs), this study will build a dataset, which aggregates data on the incidence of school-based protests in African countries. In more lay terms, this means that we will use web-based news and media sources to create a dataset of political actions since 2000. The year 2000 was selected as a starting point for this research because this is (1) when the empirical gap in the scholarly research begins, and (2) the resurgence in popular protests in Africa roughly begins.</p>

<p>Data will then be further processed to ensure that each event recorded represents a unique (set of) political action(s).</p>
